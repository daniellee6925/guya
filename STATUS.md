# guya — Status

> Last updated: 2026-06-08

## Current Focus

**Telos planning-tick hardening + Constantia sync repair (2026-06-08).** Shipped two assigned tasks (T-006, T-007), fixed a tool bug Telos itself surfaced via the new tool (guya#5), and repaired + hardened the Constantia sync daemon after the first-ever task-file merge conflict. All deployed to the Mini and verified live.

**What shipped:**
- **T-006 — planning-tick state/comms audit (graded A by Telos).** Fixed 3 gaps in the 10pm daily-plan + 9am morning ticks: (1) the 10pm tick ran in-container `git push` (ADR-024 violation) → commit-only; (2) state-(c)/(b) told the tick to "wait for Daniel's reply," impossible in a single-turn cron tick → reordered to write→commit→DM + added a "late reply to the daily-plan DM" handler to the operating contract; (3) morning tick's "dated for today" was ambiguous → pinned to the `For:` field. Deployed to Mini; forced a fresh Telos session and confirmed the late-reply behavior live. nanoclaw `51c7b5e`.
- **T-007 — `create_github_issue` MCP tool (complete).** Create-only GitHub-issue tool: REST + global `fetch` (no deps), deploy-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT pinned via container.json env, 15s timeout, both review passes. Verified by driving the deployed tool to file a real issue; Telos then used it itself to file **guya#5**. nanoclaw `7c160b2`.
- **guya#5 — `assignTask` pillar/priority broken (fixed).** Validation used a no-op `as number` cast, so MCP's string args (`"2"`) were always rejected — `assign_task` was broken for all pillar work (T-020 had been hand-written as the workaround). Coerced with `Number()` at all 10 sites, extracted a tested `isUnit123` helper, and **wired `bun test shared/telos-tools` into the telos pre-push hook** — the suite ran nowhere, so stale `formatResult` tests had silently failed for ~3 weeks. nanoclaw `082d6c3` → `bfec462` → `f1350dc`.
- **Constantia sync repair + ADR-024 amendment.** Resolved the first-ever task-file merge conflict (Telos's T-006 grade vs the laptop's completion edit collided on the `status` line) via pause→rebase→merge-keeping-both→regen MANIFEST→push→restart. Then shipped two daemon fixes (constantia `eec5382`): **idle-pull** (throttled `fetch + ff-only` so an idle Mini tracks laptop pushes ~60s — the structural prevention for this conflict class) and **deploy-key pin** (was silently using the host `guyacode` identity). Both verified live; docs propagated across ADR-024/ARCHITECTURE/CLAUDE/STATUS (`b7384bd`, `60f60f5`).

**Outstanding (carried to next session):**
- **nanoclaw#3 visual confirm.** DM Telos something with a link in it (e.g. *"send me the link to the nanoclaw repo"*) and check the link is clickable in Discord (not dead `[text](url)` text). Then close the issue. Reopen only if a real message still shows a dead link.
- **nanoclaw#2 — `@Andy` re-skin.** Cosmetic (the bot's Discord identity is 계두식 and the Telos addendum is intact); the `ASSISTANT_NAME=Andy` default lives in `launchd/com.nanoclaw.plist` and drives the @-mention trigger. Mini deploy pipeline is warm if batched soon.
- ~~**Mini unreachable since 2026-05-27.**~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-08 — reached the Mini over Tailscale and fully synced (it was the VPN toggle, as predicted).
- **`telos/.guya/` untracked-litter on the laptop.** Created during the nanoclaw#3 commit to satisfy the cross-repo pre-commit gate (which fires globally even on non-guya repos). Decide: `rm -rf` (gate will nag the next telos commit through Claude Code) vs `guya setup` telos intentionally.
- **Close guya#5.** The `assignTask` bug is fixed + deployed, but the GitHub issue is still open — the fix commit is in nanoclaw while the issue is in the guya repo (cross-repo, won't auto-close; the create-only tool can't close it). Daniel to close by hand.
- **P-023 / P-024 await Telos triage.** Filed this session: P-023 (ship a `reject_proposal` MCP tool + fix the morning-tick 5b rejection wording) and P-024 (add idempotency to `assign_task`/`propose_task` so a double-fired tick can't create duplicates). Both `target_priority: 3` — Telos re-grades at accept.

**Anti-rot watches (carried + new):**
- **Daemon heartbeat single point of trust** for "are commits making it to origin?" — unchanged from 2026-05-19.
- **~~`constantia-sync` doesn't pull on idle~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-08.** The daemon now idle-pulls (throttled 60s `fetch + merge --ff-only` in the idle branch), so laptop pushes reach an idle Mini within ~60s without waiting for a Telos commit. ADR-024 amendment, constantia `scripts/constantia-sync.sh` (`eec5382`). Manual `ssh mini` + `merge --ff-only` no longer needed for the Mini-pull direction. (Daemon also now pins the repo deploy key via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`+`IdentitiesOnly` — was silently falling back to the host `guyacode` identity.)
- **Mini on WiFi destabilizes the Discord gateway → "Telos is slow / not responding."** If all three channels go slow + respond in bursts, suspect mini's network link, NOT a container or code problem. Diagnosis: `ping -c 15 8.8.8.8` from mini — high stddev/max jitter is the tell. Fix: wired ethernet. See 2026-05-20 incident below.
- **Telos doc refresh debt** — `telos context/STATUS.md` drifts unless `/guya-telos-scribe` Pass A fires regularly.
- **Container working-tree mutations beyond rebase** — unchanged from 2026-05-19 (checkout/merge/cherry-pick hit the bind-mount wall).
- **Mini `git commit` over SSH needs `/opt/homebrew/bin` on PATH** or husky's `pnpm` pre-commit hook fails (exit 127).
- **(NEW 2026-05-27) Laptop constantia has no auto-push.** Guya logs strand locally; rebase+push manually. Detect via `git status -sb` showing `ahead N` in `~/Desktop/constantia`. Recovery pattern documented in project memory `project_constantia_laptop_sync`.
- **(NEW 2026-05-27) `systemMessage` is unreliable for plugin-sourced SessionStart hooks.** When a hook needs to reach the user (not just the model), bake the imperative into `additionalContext` so the agent relays it; treat `systemMessage` as best-effort insurance, not the primary path. The visibility-fix pattern (guya#3).

**Next session first read:**
1. **Daemon health (one-liner).** `ssh mini 'cat /Users/guya/constantia/.git/sync-status.json'` — outcome should be `ok`/`no-op`/`pulled`, heartbeat <5min. (Mini reachability + T/P-swap live confirmation both resolved 2026-06-08 — T-006 graded, idle-pull verified.)
2. **Close guya#5** on GitHub (fix deployed; cross-repo so won't auto-close).
3. **nanoclaw#3 visual confirm + close.** Did any Telos Discord message render a link clickably? If yes, close the issue.
4. **Telos triage of P-023 / P-024** — watch whether a morning tick accepts them (→ new T-tasks) or leaves them queued.
5. **nanoclaw#2 — take it or leave it.** Warm pipeline if taken now; cold restart of build+deploy if deferred.

## In Progress

- [x] **Constantia issue #1 — `check_reminders.sh` launchd silence root cause.** Closed 2026-05-21 as working-as-intended: Daniel confirmed the script fires correctly when reminders exist; the frozen mtime was idle behavior (script only writes on actual fires). Enhancement opportunity (separate from the bug): a per-tick heartbeat would distinguish idle from dead. (Will be archived after 3 days.)
- [ ] **Unit tests for `readSyncStatus`** in `guya-plugin/hooks/constantia-sync.mjs` — flagged in 2026-05-16 deep-review as Action needed. Out of scope for daemon ship; follow-up via guya-tester.
- [ ] **Laptop-side sync-status visibility.** Status file lives at `<constantia>/.git/sync-status.json` on mini only. Laptop sessions return null silently from `readSyncStatus` — alerts only fire when running Claude Code on mini (which Daniel rarely does). Options: ssh-read at session start (adds latency), daemon-pushes-throttled-status-file via git (creates churn), HTTPS health endpoint. Decide later.
- [ ] **NEXT SESSION FIRST READ — L-005 grading.** Artifact at `constantia/evidence/PILLAR2-loop-trace.md` (commit `a23340c`). If Telos hasn't graded yet, DM LEARN asking for review-then-grade.
- [ ] **NEXT SESSION SECOND READ — T-009 acceptance.** Proposal at `constantia/tasks/proposals/T-009.md` (commit `e0f70f3`). If Telos has accepted, L-007 will be at `tasks/learn/L-007.md`.
- [ ] **NEXT SESSION THIRD READ — daemon health.** Read `/Users/guya/constantia/.git/sync-status.json` on mini (via ssh). If heartbeat >5min or outcome not in {'ok','no-op','pulled'}, daemon needs attention. (Resolved 2026-05-20: WORK tick post-DM-deletion landed in channel.)
- [ ] **`/guya-telos-scribe` first real use.** Skill deployed 2026-05-20 but never invoked. Next session that touches Telos infra is the validation surface. Watch for: do passes fire cleanly? does the final-report block read well? does the daemon-stale check work on laptop (no sync-status file expected)?
- [x] **Phase 5 — Reminder firing infra. SHIPPED 2026-05-11 23:47 PT.** (Will be archived after 3 days.)
- [ ] **`<reminder>` handler in LIFE addendum.** 5-min content edit: teach `groups/telos-life/CLAUDE.local.md` to surface `<reminder>` payloads as Korean Discord DMs. Distinguish once-shot (acknowledge once) from cron (recurring nudge with action).
- [ ] **Phase 6 — Validation + cutover.** 24-hour observation: all 13 ticks fire across work/learn/life + real R-001 fire path. Day-2 review with Daniel. Update STATUS + ARCHITECTURE.
- [ ] **Day-2 content seeding (14 categories, design doc sections A-N).** Pillar 1 project decision, weekly schedule populated, 2-3 starter R-reminders (workout, Audrey baseline), first bytebytego L-task assigned, more curricula authored if wanted, profile updates, weekly meta-tasks, validator regression tests, log file evidence cleanup.
- [ ] **Tier 5 — Pillar 1 layered project.** Daniel picks: nanoGPT extended with inference optimizations (fp16 → int8 → KV cache → continuous batching), or rapGPT2.0 progressive optimization. ~1-2 hrs/week, maintenance-mode.
- [ ] **Tier 5 — Pillar 3 stats reactivation.** Schedule Wasserman's "All of Statistics" engagement into weekly plan.
- [ ] **Tier 5 — Pillar 1 foundations resumption.** Mathematics for ML book continuation.
- [ ] **Anti-rot watch (Phase 6+):** spot-check that Telos's `accept_proposal` calls vary `priority` (numeric 1/2/3) across accepts. If everything defaults to 2, field is decoration.
- [ ] **Tier 4 — Socratic testing tool (`quiz_pillar`).** Was in old plan; maybe folded into `gradeLearn` knowledge-check now. Decide whether still distinct: Phase 6 reflection.
- [ ] **Phase 2 + Phase 3 helpers.ts tests.** Phase 1 (40 pure-function tests) shipped 2026-05-06 (`7d823b3`). Phase 2 = file I/O. Phase 3 = git integration including the new daemon-handoff. Test debt grew further this week with the `commitOnly` refactor + daemon (zero new unit tests).
- [ ] **Validator-extraction follow-up.** Inline validation logic across `assignTask`, `gradeTask`, `acceptProposal`, `proposeTask`, `assignLearn`, `addReminder`, `gradeLearn`, `writeEvidence`, `writeReflection` — each does its own enum/length/conditional checks. Time to extract to `validators.ts`.
- [ ] **guya-hook-smoke needs synthetic-rebase test.** Pre-push check should add a synthetic rebase that asserts the constantia post-commit hook guard fires correctly. Without it, a future hook edit could re-introduce the silent-rot regression.
- [ ] **ADR for plist-env Docker discovery + check other LaunchAgents.** Worth: (1) ADR entry; (2) audit other launchctl plists on mini for the PATH gap; (3) consider `DOCKER_HOST` env var as belt-and-suspenders.
- [ ] **Investigate TCC permission stability for Desktop.** Desktop access revoked twice during 5/5 session. Migration option: move Constantia from `~/Desktop/constantia` to `~/constantia` (matches mini clone, sidesteps macOS Desktop TCC).
- [ ] **Per-agent SSH config durability.** `Dockerfile.gh-ssh-config` lives in `/tmp` on mini (ephemeral). Future per-agent rebuild from base would lose it. Skip until next per-agent rebuild forces the issue.

**Phase 5 cleanup (still pending across multiple sessions):**
- [ ] **[LOW — Phase 5 cleanup] Delete dead `review-gate.json` + scribe reference.**
- [ ] **[LOW — Phase 5 cleanup] Delete zombie tactical guideline files.** Two files in `.guya/evolution/guidelines/tactical/` (`1775671829028.md`, `1775672037132.md`) contain raw user-prompt text from an older code path.
- [ ] **[LOW — Phase 5 cleanup] Delete dead `active-guidelines.md` placeholder.**
- [ ] **[LOW — Phase 5 cleanup] Fix lying docstring + return value in `guya-correction-detect.mjs`.**
- [ ] **[LOW — Phase 5 cleanup] Update ADR 002 in CLAUDE.md.** Currently says "fully autonomous evolution, no approval gates." Should reflect manual `/guya-evolve` decision from 2026-04-11.

## TODO

- [ ] **[MED] Define `telos context/goal.md` curriculum threshold for absence-based patterns.** "Two consecutive weeks of an expected recurring behavior failing to occur" needs operational definition.
- [ ] **[LOW — flagged 2026-05-06] Source-resolution branch in `synthesizeFromReflections` lacks direct unit-test coverage.**
- [ ] **[LOW — flagged 2026-04-27] Add `auto-evidence.test.mjs`.**
- [ ] **[LOW — flagged 2026-04-27] Block Claude from editing review hook + hooks.json.**
- [ ] **[MED — Codex 2026-04-09] Unknown schema versions silently dropped by `parseLine`.**
- [ ] **[LOW] `hasLearningSignal` tool-name parser doesn't match `file_edit` trace content format.**
- [ ] **[LOW — DRY follow-up] Extract `isMain` gate pattern into `hook-utils.mjs`** — duplicated in `guya-session-end.mjs` and `guya-correction-detect.mjs`.
- [ ] **[MED] `hasLearningSignal` reads fields no producer writes.** `trace.context` and `trace.toolOutput` — neither is written by any known trace producer.
- [ ] Follow-up commit: apply review findings from 2026-04-08 karpathy-review pass — add `console.error` logging to silent catches in `hook-utils.mjs:36,40`, `intent-detect.mjs:91`, `correction-detect.mjs:101`.
- [ ] Decide fate of line 52 in `~/.claude/guya/traces/2026-04-09.jsonl` — "I have noticed while working on SDF" preference.
- [ ] **Post-commit manifest hook bug** — globs working-tree files including untracked. Low priority.
- [ ] Comprehensive logging system for guya plugin hooks.
- [ ] Claude code guide — living doc, update as new patterns discovered.
- [ ] Growth tracker milestone #2: read and critique someone else's code.
- [ ] Growth tracker milestone #5: review code Guya writes — pick one function per session.

## Decisions & Notes

- [2026-05-27] **Constantia laptop sync — the laptop has no auto-push (operational discovery).** Laptop drifted to `ahead 1, behind 12` plus an orphaned 5/26 voice-chat log because Guya's `/guya-reflect` commits had no mechanism to reach origin. Root cause: ADR-024 removed the post-commit auto-push when the `constantia-sync` daemon took over, but the daemon only manages the Mini's checkout (`/Users/guya/constantia`), not the laptop's (`~/Desktop/constantia`). So laptop commits sit locally until manually rebased + pushed. **Sync pattern (works cleanly):** (1) `git fetch` + `git rebase origin/main` — the post-commit hook self-skips during rebase via `$GIT_DIR/{rebase-merge,…}` guards, so MANIFEST regeneration doesn't dirty the working tree mid-rebase (the lesson from ADR-019). (2) Conflicts on the generated MANIFESTs (`tasks/MANIFEST.md`, `log/MANIFEST.md`) are usually truncation-width regen noise — resolve `--ours` (origin's base in rebase terms); a later real commit's regen fixes them canonically. (3) Commit any orphan logs **after** the rebase — the post-commit hook then regenerates all three MANIFESTs from the merged directory state and `--amend`s them in. (4) `git push` (pre-push hook validates with `wip` + `guya-hook-smoke`). Mini unreachable during sync is fine — VPN/Tailscale toggle, not an outage; daemon self-catches-up on reconnect (Telos ticks vs Guya logs touch different files → clean rebase). Saved as `project_constantia_laptop_sync` memory. **Append-only discipline still applies** — never force-push shared truth.

- [2026-05-21] **Issue sweep — three GitHub issues resolved across two repos, two closed + one deployed pending visual confirm.**

  **guya#3 — evolve nudge invisibility (`8e5ae79`, closed).** The `<guya-context>` block included a backlog nudge ("📝 N reflections accumulated, days since last evolve") but the user never saw it — the hook was writing it into `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, which Claude Code injects into Guya's context window only, not the chat UI. Verified the obvious fix (`systemMessage` top-level field) is unreliable for plugin-sourced SessionStart hooks in the 2.1.x range (silently dropped). So the only channel guaranteed to reach Daniel is **Guya's own first reply**. New `formatNudgeDirective()` wraps the bare nudge in a "🔔 SHOW DANIEL FIRST — he cannot see this block" imperative inside `additionalContext`, so the relay instruction travels with the nudge to every project with zero CLAUDE.md dependency. `systemMessage` also set as best-effort native-CLI insurance. The pattern is self-detecting (if nudges stop appearing, Daniel notices), unlike the silent-rot cases the repo guards against. 3 new tests pin the directive contract so a future cleanup can't revert it. **Visibility-fix pattern added to ARCHITECTURE Decision Log.**

  **nanoclaw#3 — Discord masked links not clickable (telos `3479f1d`, deployed, open pending visual confirm).** Telos's briefs emitted Markdown `[text](url)` masked links, but Discord doesn't render those in normal bot messages (only in embeds) — they showed as dead literal text and Daniel was copy-pasting URLs by hand daily. New `src/channels/format-links.ts` exports `bareDiscordLinks()`: a pure transform that rewrites `[text](url)` → `text: url` (or bare `url` when label empty/equals url), leaves inline + fenced code untouched, ignores non-http targets (anchors, relative, numeric), strips the leading `!` of image links. Wired Discord-only via the bridge's existing `transformOutboundText` extension point — Slack uses `<url|text>` and Telegram renders Markdown natively, so neither needs this. Ask-question card embeds also untouched (Discord renders masked links inside embeds). 13 unit tests cover labels, images, multi-link, code-span exclusion, idempotence. Length-impact analysis: rewrite is strictly **shorter** than original (`[t](u)` = t+u+4 chars; `t: u` = t+u+2), so no new truncation risk in front of `splitForLimit`. tsc clean. Mini deploy: pull → `npm run build` → `launchctl kickstart -k com.nanoclaw-v2-53edea47` (PID 12231→10994); Discord Gateway reconnected as 계두식; ran the deployed `dist/channels/format-links.js` on the Mini's own node and confirmed `[the PR](https://…)` → `the PR: https://…`, inline code preserved, bare URLs untouched. **Known limitation (punted per issue):** URLs with balanced parens (e.g. Wikipedia `..._(disambiguation)`) lose the trailing `)` — standard regex-Markdown tradeoff, rare in Telos's actual output. Open until Daniel eyeballs a real Discord message.

  **constantia#1 — `check_reminders.sh` "silent for 2+ days" (closed working-as-intended).** Original report: launchd job loaded but no logs/sidecar updates for 46 hours. After Daniel confirmed reminders fire correctly when scheduled, the diagnosis flipped: the script's log + sidecar are only written when it actually *does* something, and `StartInterval=60` with no eligible reminders produces no observable signal. The frozen mtime aligned with the last scheduled reminder (5/14 ~11pm PT). Not a bug. Noted on the issue as an enhancement opportunity: a positive per-tick heartbeat (write a tiny status line every fire whether or not a reminder triggers) would distinguish "idle" from "dead" — the same silent-rot gap as ADR-011/012/013, this time at the cron-script tier. Filed as future consideration, not a defect.

  **Cross-cutting: `telos/.guya/` litter on the laptop.** When committing the nanoclaw#3 fix in `~/Desktop/telos`, the global guya pre-commit gate (Claude Code `PreToolUse:Bash` dispatcher) fired against a non-guya repo and demanded review evidence. The `/guya-review` skills couldn't supply it cleanly because their auto-evidence records against the session cwd (guya), not the commit's repo (telos). Resolved by running both review passes inline (Karpathy + deep), then deterministically recording evidence via `appendStep` targeting telos directly — creating an untracked `.guya/evolution/review-evidence.jsonl` in telos. Untracked, local-only, not in the telos commit, but litter on the fork. Open question carried forward: clean it up vs `guya setup` telos intentionally so the gate works there with proper config. The deeper issue worth thinking about: the global gate should probably honor `.guya/`-absence as "this isn't a guya-managed repo, skip" rather than firing everywhere.

- [2026-05-21, later same day] **T/P prefix swap executed + deployed (Constantia task `T-005`, née `P-005`).** The naming was backwards: `T-NNN` lived in `tasks/proposals/` (a proposal) and `P-NNN` in `tasks/tasks/` (a task). Swapped so `T`=Task, `P`=Proposal. **Spans three repos, so atomicity is per-repo, not one commit** (the acceptance text said "single commit" — impossible across repos): nanoclaw `f8a31c0`+`2eba7ef` (validators/minters/all tick prompts), constantia `59775be`+`82ee54a` (16 renames + cross-refs + both hooks + dated CLAUDE.md legend + T-005 complete), guya `3fab2cb`+`4ef2d48` (ADR-025 + ARCHITECTURE schema + plan doc). **Cut-over on the live Mini:** freeze (`launchctl unload` nanoclaw + constantia-sync) → push all 3 → `git pull` on Mini → reload daemons → verify. **No container rebuild** — `shared/telos-tools/` is bind-mounted RO into session containers and `groups/` prompts are read live; a pull deploys. **Immutable history (Daniel's call):** dated logs/evidence/archive NOT rewritten — pre-swap IDs keep old meaning per the CLAUDE.md legend; only live state migrated. **Five gotchas, all worth remembering:** (1) local clones were stale — telos was 6 commits behind origin, so the migration was rebuilt on current code incl. 2 new planning-tick prompts the stale base never had; *always fetch + check ahead/behind before a multi-repo migration*. (2) the Mini had uncommitted prompt refinements (always-report rule, 기억나무 anchor, midday questions) that nearly got lost on pull — recovered + reswapped. (3) a blanket ID-swap corrupts convention-*describing* prose — the migration's own `T-005`/`P-007` purpose/acceptance got letter-flipped into nonsense; restore the meta-files by hand (saved as memory `feedback-migration-convention-prose`). (4) `constantia-sync` exits before fetch when `local == last_pushed` → doesn't pull on idle; manual ff needed after pushing from the dev box. (5) Mini `git commit` over SSH needs `/opt/homebrew/bin` on PATH or husky's pnpm hook 127s. Live confirmation still pending: the next ID-minting tick (`P-012`/`T-006`). Full plan: `docs/2026-05-21-tp-swap-migration.md`. Filed `nanoclaw#2` (ASSISTANT_NAME=Andy leftover, cosmetic) along the way.

- [2026-05-21] **Learn-task ID migration — flat `L-NNN` is now canonical + enforced.** Daniel flagged Telos's learn tasks as having confusing labels. Root cause: Constantia `CLAUDE.md`'s ID-conventions section was stale (documented the pre-2026-05-08 `TASK-NNN` scheme, said nothing about learn IDs) and the pre-commit hook validated ID *uniqueness* but never *format* — so Telos minted flat `L-NNN` while a 2026-05-14 Guya session invented a pillar-prefixed `L-Pn-NNN` scheme; both passed validation and coexisted (`L-003` and `L-P2-001` were sibling Pillar-2 tasks with unrelated-looking IDs). Telos was actually the *consistent* one — flat matches `P-`/`T-`/`R-`/`EVD-`; Guya was the deviation. Fix (constantia `d53f096`): rewrote the ID-conventions spec, added an `^L-[0-9]{3}$` gate to `validate_learn` (gate-proven both ways before migrating), and migrated **append-only** — `L-P1-001→L-004`, `L-P2-001→L-005`, `L-P3-001→L-006`, and `L-003→L-007` (superseded: old L-003 archived as a frozen tombstone, recreated as L-007 so the follow-up sorts after its parent L-005). Chose append over chronological renumber: reusing numbers would make old logs ambiguous; append keeps a clean bijection (every old ID maps to exactly one new ID, no reuse). Dated logs/evidence/reflections left as history; mapping recorded in constantia `log/guya/2026-05-21-guya-6ef35ae8.md`. One-shot supervised crossing into Telos-owned `evidence/`+`goals/` (Daniel-authorized; not a precedent for ongoing co-writing). This guya-repo `STATUS.md` + `telos context/STATUS.md` had their *live* pointers updated to flat IDs; dated changelog entries left as history. **Note surfaced:** the remote commit we rebased onto was Telos accepting `T-007` → task `P-005` (the T-/P- naming swap) — accepted but not yet executed.

- [2026-05-20 evening] **Telos "all channels slow" incident — root cause was mini on WiFi, not Telos.** Daniel reported all three channels (WORK/LIFE/LEARN) slow and responding in bursts, LIFE stuck. Diagnosis chain: (1) host healthy — load decreasing 2.18→1.15, disk 7%, memory fine, 19-day uptime, no crashes; (2) `nanoclaw.log` showed 24 `GATEWAY_RESUMED` events flapping every 7-78 min — the Discord gateway WebSocket repeatedly reconnecting; (3) my own SSH (tailnet path) was intermittently timing out, and Discord (regular-internet path) was also flaky → both paths affected = mini's underlying network, not one service; (4) `ping -c 15 8.8.8.8` from mini: **0% packet loss but 37ms stddev / 143ms max jitter** (min was 7.9ms) — the fingerprint of an unstable WiFi link. The 80% loss to the local gateway IP (192.168.1.254) was a red herring — routers deprioritize ICMP to their own management IP; the clean 8.8.8.8 path proved transit was fine. **Mechanism:** one nanoclaw process holds one shared Discord gateway WebSocket serving all three sessions; WiFi latency spikes blew past Discord's heartbeat-ACK timeout → gateway declared zombied → reconnect → all channels stall during each reconnect window → burst delivery on resume. **Fix:** Daniel connected ethernet. Jitter collapsed from 37ms stddev → 0.4ms stddev (143ms max → 7.6ms max). **Confirmation:** 25-min log watch (19:57-20:22 PDT) showed 0 new `GATEWAY_RESUMED` vs the ~3-4 expected on the old WiFi cadence. No code change, no container intervention — physical-layer the whole way. **Lesson + anti-rot watch added:** this recurs any time mini goes back to WiFi, and it presents as "Telos is slow" rather than an obvious network error — always check mini's network link when ALL channels are sluggish at once. (Tooling note: first watch attempt silently no-op'd because `timeout` isn't on macOS — relaunched with count-sleep-count. Same silent-failure family the project keeps hitting.)

- [2026-05-20, long session] **Telos doc surface rebuilt + new `/guya-telos-scribe` skill + L-P2-001 module artifact shipped.** Three threaded arcs across the day, plus one major integrity learning.

  **Arc 1 — Telos doc 13-day staleness catch-up.** Audited `telos context/STATUS.md` (Guya-repo subfolder for Telos design docs); last touched 2026-05-06, missing 11 ADRs and multiple shipped systems (3-session WORK/LIFE/LEARN, ADR-024 daemon, planning ticks, `write_evidence` MCP tool, expanded MCP tool surface). Rewrote Next session / Current State / Runtime / Identity / In Progress sections + added Catch-up Summary listing 5/6→5/19 deltas + boundary notes on historical sections. Sibling fixes: `goal.md` Pillar 1 project lock + review date refresh; deleted stale `operating-rules-draft.md`; patched Constantia `goals/pillars.md` + `open-questions.md` + `milestones.md`. Commits: guya `008d723`, constantia `76a9c4a`.

  **Arc 2 — `/guya-telos-scribe` skill created.** Diagnosed that the staleness happened because Daniel says "scribe" reflexively but `/guya-scribe` is project-universal (used in SDF, BosonAI, etc.) and doesn't touch Telos-specific surfaces. Created sibling skill via `/guya-skill-creator` harness — project-scoped to Guya, three independent passes (A Telos infra → `telos context/STATUS.md`, B commitments → `goal.md`, C Constantia decisions → `pillars/milestones/open-questions`). Skip-silently when no signal; `<GUYA>` / `<CONSTANTIA>` path placeholders with config-based resolution; daemon-stale heartbeat warning before Constantia commits with parse-failure handling; confirm-before-touch rule for `vision.md` + `core-beliefs.md`. Two-pass review (guya-review + guya-deep-review) caught path fragility, commit-failure handling, sync-status schema mismatches, pass co-firing logic. Final report on explicit invocation; suppressed on auto-trigger when no passes fire. Commit: guya `241b9ab`.

  **Arc 3 — L-P2-001 module artifact via 6-layer teach.** Walked the Telos agent loop end-to-end with Daniel: Layer 1 (recurrence propagator host-side), Layer 2 (poll loop container-side), Layer 3 (Claude SDK query with addendum/continuation asymmetry), Layer 4 (response handling with envelope blocks + 3-tier fallback), Layer 5 (outbound row writeout via outbox pattern), Layer 6 (Discord delivery with at-least-once semantics). Daniel answered + Guya corrected at each layer. Concept-checks #1, #3, #4, #5 cemented through the teach; #2 (kind=task vs kind=chat-sdk) covered with origin + spawn-eligibility-via-trigger-field framing. Three failure points: ADR-018 (SDK resume freezes prompt), ADR-021 (empty-string `thread_id` via JS `??`), today's WORK DM Tier 4 silent scratchpad bug. Cross-application paragraph identifies outbox pattern as portable improvement for SDF orchestrator. Also proposed T-009 (L-P2-002, host/container split L-task) during teach when container-spawn deep-dive surfaced as out-of-scope for L-P2-001. Commits: constantia `a23340c` (artifact) + `e0f70f3` (T-009 proposal).

  **Major integrity learning.** Mid-teach session, Guya drafted PILLAR2-loop-trace.md from Explore subagent output and attributed it to Daniel ("Author: Daniel Lee" in frontmatter) BEFORE Daniel had done any layer work. Daniel caught via verification question — *"can you tell me who and when they wrote this?"* — gave Guya the room to confess cleanly. Artifact deleted, rebuilt collaboratively from layer-by-layer teach. **Rule locked in 2026-05-20 reflection:** never attribute authorship to Daniel without his explicit edit pass; authorship attribution is identity-level state — treat with the care of a production DB write.

  **Two other adjustments captured in 2026-05-20 reflection:**
  - Before claiming Constantia task state (e.g., "nothing assigned in LEARN"), ALWAYS read `tasks/MANIFEST.md` first. Hallucinated this early in session, caught only by Daniel asking "are you sure?".
  - In teach mode, default is collaborative-build not draft-then-edit. If wanting to write a complete artifact "to save time," stop and check whether learning is the goal.

  **Cross-repo commits summary:** guya `008d723` + `241b9ab`; constantia `76a9c4a` + `e0f70f3` + `a23340c`; plus reflection log committed at constantia `42ebd4d`.

  **What stayed deferred:**
  - L-P2-001 grading (pending Telos read on next LEARN tick or explicit DM ask)
  - T-009 acceptance (pending Telos read of MANIFEST update)
  - `/guya-telos-scribe` first real invocation (skill never run; next Telos infra change is the validation surface)
  - Container-spawn deep-dive findings (countDueMessages, trigger field gate, host-sweep as spawn trigger, cold-vs-warm latency) — saved as L-P2-002 prep material in this session's conversation log; not pre-loaded into T-009.

- [2026-05-19] **Discord 2000-char truncation fixed + WORK DM destination removed.** Two small surgical fixes:
  - **Discord splitter re-wired (telos fork `5cf11b6`, closes nanoclaw#1).** The `splitForLimit()` function and the `maxTextLength` config field at `src/channels/chat-sdk-bridge.ts:104-416` both existed and were tested but never activated — `src/channels/discord.ts` was creating the bridge without setting `maxTextLength`. Six-line fix: add `maxTextLength: 2000` to the Discord adapter config. Splits on paragraph → line → space → hard-char. Nanoclaw rebuilt via `pnpm build` (writes `dist/`); launchd kickstarted to load the new binary. Discord gateway reconnected as 계두식 within seconds.
  - **WORK DM destination removed.** Daniel reported WORK Telos sending proactive ticks to DM instead of the WORK Discord channel. Inspected routing data: WORK had TWO destinations in v2.db `agent_destinations` (`unnamed` → channel, `discord-mg-17789` → DM, added 2026-05-17) AND TWO in WORK's per-session destinations table. Deleted the `discord-mg-17789` row from both layers. Now WORK's addendum will list channel only; proactive ticks (NULL incoming routing) forced to channel. Reactive DM replies still work via scratchpad-fallback on incoming routing. LIFE + LEARN inspected — already channel-only, no change needed. **Caveat:** running WORK container has stale addendum per ADR-018 (Claude SDK resume freezes the prompt); next fresh spawn after container kill or `/clear` picks up the new state. As of this writing, WORK container wasn't running (absolute-ceiling'd earlier), so next natural tick fire will spawn fresh and inherit the channel-only routing.

- [2026-05-16, full-day session] **ADR-024 — constantia-sync daemon shipped end-to-end.** Started as "why is mini's git silently failing to push commits for 2 days" debug; ended as a structural rewrite of how container-side and host-side git operations divide responsibility.

  **Diagnostic chain (4 hypotheses, 3 refuted, 1 confirmed):**
  - **H1 — concurrent-container race.** Fired WORK and LIFE test ticks with identical `process_after` timestamps to force simultaneity. Containers serialized ~14s apart per the instrumented `commitAndPush` log. **Refuted.**
  - **H3 — mid-flight working-tree dirt.** Hypothesis: something writes files between `git commit` and `git rebase`, dirtying the working tree. Instrumented log showed `git status --porcelain` clean at the `before-rebase` stage in every failure. **Refuted.**
  - **H4 — container git version too old.** Container ships Debian git 2.39.5; host has Apple Git 2.50.1. Installed git 2.47.3 in a running container via `apt -t trixie install git`. Re-ran the same rebase: **same failure with new git.** **Refuted.**
  - **H5 — Docker bind-mount filesystem semantics.** Cross-test: `cp -R /workspace/extra/constantia /tmp/c-test` (overlay filesystem, no bind mount). Same git binary, same data, same container — rebase **succeeded** end-to-end on overlay. Failed identically on bind mount. **Confirmed.** Git's `unpack-trees` safety check misreads working-tree state through the macOS Docker bind mount (gRPC FUSE / virtio-fs) and refuses to update files that would be touched by a rebase pick, even when the change comes from a committed-but-not-yet-pushed local commit.

  **Architecture deployed:**
  - **Container side:** `helpers.ts:commitAndPush(message)` renamed `commitOnly(message, paths)`. Drops fetch + rebase + push entirely. All 10 MCP-tool callers in `mcp-server.ts` updated to pass the specific paths they wrote (kills the latent `git add -A` cross-container race). `appendTickLogSection` now returns its log path so callers can include it.
  - **Host side:** new `constantia-sync` launchd daemon (`com.guya.constantia-sync` plist, script at `/Users/guya/constantia/scripts/constantia-sync.sh`). Polls `/Users/guya/constantia/` every 5s. Each cycle: abort any stale rebase (recovery), check local SHA vs last-pushed, if behind run `git fetch + rebase + push` on host's native APFS git. Status JSON at `<constantia>/.git/sync-status.json` written every cycle (atomic tmp + rename).
  - **Guya side:** `guya-plugin/hooks/constantia-sync.mjs` exports `readSyncStatus(constantiaPath)` returning an alert string when heartbeat is stale (>5min) or last cycle errored. `guya-session-start.mjs` emits a `constantia-sync-alert` section when the alert fires; silent in the healthy or not-deployed case.

  **Cascade fixes uncovered in same session:**
  - Constantia post-commit hook used `python3` in its `trunc` helper. Container image doesn't ship python3 → hook silently aborted under `set -e` mid-MANIFEST-regen → left tasks/MANIFEST.md dirty after every commit → next rebase failed with "your local changes would be overwritten" on a different file than the bind-mount error → cause was mistaken for the same issue. Replaced `trunc` with pure-bash parameter expansion (constantia `deeb32c`).
  - Constantia post-commit hook auto-push block: dropped (constantia `1930445`). Daemon is the only pusher.
  - `check_reminders.sh` inline `git pull --rebase && git push`: dropped (constantia `37ff5b4`). Just commits locally; daemon pushes.

  **Bootstrap operation:** 21-commit backlog accumulated on mini's local main since 2026-05-14 (every helpers.ts cycle hit the bind-mount rebase failure, auto-aborted, retained the local commit, pushed nothing). Pushed the entire backlog from host in one rebase + push: `7f2d61a..0257c57`.

  **Validation:** Three verification ticks fired sequentially. Parallel-run with old helpers.ts active + daemon active: daemon detected the new local SHA within 5s and pushed cleanly. Post-refactor tick with new `commitOnly`: container committed only `log/telos/2026-05-16-tick.md` (the explicit path), daemon pushed within 5s. Daemon has been running stable since.

  **What stayed unresolved (deferred):**
  - Laptop-side sync-status visibility — status file is mini-local; laptop sessions return null silently.
  - Unit tests for `readSyncStatus`.
  - Constantia issue #1 (`check_reminders.sh` launchd silence since 2026-05-14) — script's git flow now refactored, but the underlying "why isn't launchd firing" question is separate.

  **Mistakes I (Guya) should remember:**
  - Initial fix recommendation was "move all git ops to host" (the daemon does everything). Daniel pushed back: "what about commits, can containers still do those?" He was right — containers can commit fine through the bind mount (proven by 21 successful commits in the backlog). Only working-tree operations like rebase fail. The hybrid is cleaner than my original. **Lesson: Daniel's pushback on my fix proposal led to the better architecture. When the proposal is dismissive of one half of the system, check whether that half is genuinely broken or just adjacent to the broken half.**
  - Pivoted prematurely to "must be git version" (H4) after H1/H3 refuted. Tested it via in-container `apt install git -t trixie` (cheap, definitive) — refuted. Worth the 15 min. **Lesson: when a hypothesis is cheap to test, test it before committing to the harder fix.**

  **Cross-repo commits:** telos fork `184a7d5` (helpers.ts refactor); constantia `0257c57` + `deeb32c` + `1930445` + `37ff5b4` (cascade); guya `bf46252` (session-start surface) + `80b2fb0` (ADR-024).
